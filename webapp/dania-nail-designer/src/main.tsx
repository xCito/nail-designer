GOALS
  #1: Consultation will be like chat bot help instead of flat page w lists

  #2:
  (new) Consultation options -> Desired Service; Basic Manicure, 
  Gel Manicure, Extensions/Enhancements, New Set, Take-Down Removal

  Gel Manicure is Basic Manicure w BaseGel in “Foundation” ON. 
  Base gel is same as Gel Manicure

  #3:
  Consultation; Removing prior design or set?, 
  what is your “Desired Service”? show options, 
  (add) “Desired Base” next using the bubbles from “Foundation”,
  include manicure?, Is your desired service: xyz?, 
  if yes; Consultation Complete button appears & move on to “Design”

  #4:
  Add “Add-Ons”; Gems, Charms, Extra Skin Smoothing 
  or Dry Skin Treatment (or both? as individual services)

  #5:
  Manicure is $20 again 👀

  #6:
  If click “Take Down”, include manicure, base gel 
  turns on but there are no pre or during service shaping options 

  #7:
  Put “Consultation”, “Foundation”, “Design” as tabs under the title & úña
